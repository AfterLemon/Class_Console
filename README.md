Class_Console
=============

Thank you for your interest! Good ol' tidbit and I worked on this with ease of use, seamless handling, and robust ability in mind. We hope you like it.
As always, we're both here, and on the IRC channel (irc.freenode.net #ahk & #ahkscript) to help.

Now on to the details:

This class is meant to simplify debugging for scripts from simple text handling, to outputting and logging data & arrays.
There's a lot here, so jump in and test it out using our demo scripts below, or write your own setup and tell us what you think we need to add!
