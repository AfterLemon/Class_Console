Description:
	A sort of debugging console for your script. Display variables, arrays, CSV 
	and other delimited data, script info like Variables and Last Lines and more in 
	a console-like Gui. You may also use the Command Bar to show info without needing to
	call stuff from the program. You may also do math or modify variables content.

Notes:
 * "debugType" is the type of information using AutoHotkey's Built-in logs for
   KeyHistory, ListVars (Vars), ListLines (Lines), and ListHotkeys (Hotkeys).
 * "TimeFormat" should be 0, 1 or any "FormatTime" format. 0 = none. 1=A_Now (default)
   otherwise format it according to the FormatTime docs.
 * YOu may use HTML and CSS (well, CSS mostly, not really html) to theme your console. Default is high-contrast light-on-dark.
